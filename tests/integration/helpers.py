    """Returns members defined on `cls`, excluding some base classes.

    By default, only members provided by the pybind11 base class and Python are
    excluded (e.g., default operator implementations).  `depth` can be used to
    exclude members starting from that position in the method resolution order
    (e.g., for `depth=1` only members defined on `cls` itself are returned.)

    Parameters:
        predicate: Only return members whose definition fulfills this predicate.
        depth: Only return members this deep into the method resolution order.

    Returns:
        A dictionary mapping the members' names to their definitions.
